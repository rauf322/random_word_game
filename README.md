# Random Word Game 🎲
I've just created a fun little Python game using the **random_word** library! 🚀

To dive in and play:
1. Make sure you have **Python 3.10.9+** installed.
2. Install the required library:
   ```bash
   pip install random_word
   ```
3. Run the game:

That's it! The game is ready and waiting for you. 🎉 Happy playing! 🎮
